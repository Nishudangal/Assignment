	</br>According to Forrester Research, 47 percent of companies are behind in their digital transformation efforts because they’re unable to implement digital transformation strategies effectively. Digital innovators steal market share from incumbents by creating disruptive business models and superior customer experiences.

The ability to deliver applications for employees, partners and customers quickly and at scale is core to every digital transformation strategy. Organizations need to optimize application development productivity by empowering professional developers and citizen developers simultaneously.

Scaling application development across the enterprise
Not all business applications require professional software development talent. However, medium to large enterprises need assurances that all internal and customer-facing apps meet certain pre-defined criteria whether those businesses are regulated or not.

Developers can help empower citizen developers by building reusable components that contain built-in guardrails and governance. That way, business professionals can easily construct apps that meet departmental needs and adhere to architectural and governance requirements such as security access control, API contracts, regulatory compliance and service-level agreements.

“Citizen developers should be able to do more than create simple forms-based applications or dashboards. They should be able to create powerful omni-channel applications like professional developers without breaking other things or introducing security vulnerabilities,” said Carlos Carvajal, chief marketing officer at Kony.</p>

</br>It is an interesting time to be a web developer. On one hand, the web today provides a wealth of information, giving developers easy access to a number of resources useful when running into a problem or wanting to update their skills. Additionally, there are so many advancements being made to programming languages and technologies that web development provides a rich ecosystem for developers to build powerful solutions. 

“The horizon for web developers has really widened in the last couple of years where we are able to choose literally what type of app we want to build and what type of experience we want to have,” said Sam Basu, developer advocate for app development solution provider Progress. 

On the other hand, that rich ecosystem can also be fatiguing because there are now so many different technologies and languages to choose from. It can be difficult to decide what tools development teams and organizations should invest in — not to mention all the different form factors and other user demands web developers have to worry about. 

“If you are new to the game, you may struggle with the number of options available to you. There are new frameworks coming up every day, so it ends up becoming a problem of too many options and too many riches,” Basu said. “For web developers, the canvas is broadening. We have other things to keep in mind as we are building applications and our code is reaching new forms that were never really meant for the web.”

Luckily, these problems are not going unsolved and there are currently a number of trends and solutions underway aimed at making web developers’ lives easier. 

Progressive Web Applications
You may be a web developer, but your web development strategy can no longer just be the web, according to Jason Wong, VP analyst at the research firm Gartner. Users are accessing solutions on so many different form factors that organizations are now expected to provide a mobile experience.

An emerging trend developers and organizations are turning to is progressive web apps (PWAs), which have been on the rise for the past couple of years now, with 2018 being reported as their breakout year. When Apple announced support for service workers in the beginning of last year, it paved the way for PWAs. Now that we are in 2019, Wong explained we are now entering Gartner’s trough of disillusionment on the hype cycle. “It is just a matter of time, maturity and formation of standards across browsers and operating systems that is going to ultimately drive the entry into mainstream and slope of enlightenment,” he said.

PWAs give development teams the ability to use web technologies to build a mobile experience without having to go through the app store. According to Wong, PWAs are not meant to be a replacement for mobile applications. They are a replacement for bad mobile applications and can be a stepping stone to a broader mobile strategy. “Organizations that simply want to have a presence in the app store go about it backwards. They take what is already available or mobile friendly, and they wrap it and publish it as a hybrid app or a very basic mobile app to the app store. They don’t get the adoption or engagement they were looking for because they didn’t really think of mobile as a strategic investment,” said Wong. “The PWA approach allows them to take more of a toe-in-the-water approach to really understanding what it means to build an app-like experience.” </p>
